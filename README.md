### Hi there, I'm Laura 👋

I'm a biologist/neuroscientist turned into a Research Software Engineer working at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/). I'm part of the Margrie Lab and the Neuroinformatics Unit. My day-to-day work involves developing tools to analyze and visualize calcium imaging data.

- 🔬 I’m working on:
  * [derotation](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/derotation): a package designed to correct images acquired through 3-photon microscopes. This tool rotates line-by-line images to counteract speciment rotation, enabling further analysis.

In my free time I've a few coding hobbies/projects:
- 🌱 I’m currently learning creative coding with [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/docs/) (⚠️ flashing lights):
  * [my first video synth open mic](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=oEzZyqkEQYzVXMX0)
  * [October 2024 live coding meetup sketch](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=4ydauMG7zIpwe6jj)
  * [Corsica Studio December 2024 sketch](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=FwbXQAhpk25OyuNW)
- 🏗️ I'm currently building a pen-plotter to be used with [BrachioGraph](https://www.brachiograph.art/)
