### Hi there, I'm Laura ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Research Software Engineer working at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) in collaboration with the Margrie Lab. My day-to-day work involves developing innovative tools to analyze and visualize calcium imaging data, providing insights into the intricacies of the mouse visual cortex.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two main projects:
  * [rsp_vision](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/rsp-vision): a Python package aimed at analyzing responses in the retrosplenial cortex to drifting gratings. I'm leveraging `Dash Plotly` to create interactive visualizations that bring data to life.
  * [derotation](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/derotation): a specialized package designed to correct images acquired through 3-photon microscopes. This tool meticulously rotates line-by-line images to counteract sample rotation, ensuring precise analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [dataviz](https://www.amazon.com/Truthful-Art-Data-Charts-Communication/dp/0321934075), [statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/pages/syllabus/) and [painting](https://artacademy.ac.uk/painting-classes/).
